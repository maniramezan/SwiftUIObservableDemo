SwiftUIObservableDemo

This Repository is a demo of SwiftUI iOS 17 Observable macro. This includes two sample projects:

- ObservableDemo: This project demonstrates the use of @Observable macro in SwiftUI. It includes prior iOS 17 code using `ObservableObject` and then show cases the new `@Observable` macro.
- ObservableConsole: A console mac app that demonstrates how observable generally works by show casing the usage of `withObservationTracking` global function.

These sample projects were part of a demo for [Kodeco accelerator bootcamp for iOS](https://bootcamp.kodeco.com).
